    <h1>Our Snowy Story</h1>
    <p>
      It started with a dream, and a dad who had never touched skis. <span class="highlight">Dr. Ramzi Haraty</span>, a man who adored the beauty of Lebanon’s snowy mountains but had never ventured onto the slopes, decided it was time for a change. And not just for him, for his entire family.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s when <span class="highlight">Software Snakes</span> entered the picture. We’re not just your typical group of Computer Science students, we’re also passionate winter sports instructors: <strong>Ranim, Reina, Antonio, Rabab,</strong> and <strong>Kareen</strong>. Five friends, bonded by code, snowflakes, and a whole lot of ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few intense months of private tutoring, Dr. Haraty’s kids competed in a national skiing competition. Their talent turned heads, but especially the heads of the marketing team from <span class="highlight">Crest</span>, the toothpaste brand. Seeing kids glide like pros with smiles as bright as the snow, Crest approached us with a sponsorship deal we couldn’t refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Crest’s support and our vision, we launched <strong>Haraty’s Winter Crest Academy</strong>—a place where snow, tech, and dreams meet.
      Our academy isn’t just about learning how to ski or snowboard; it’s about building confidence, mastering new skills, and embracing the chill with a smile. ❄️
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, HWCA offers top-tier lessons in skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, sledding, and ice climbing. Whether you're a total newbie or a pro looking to level up, we’ve got courses tailored for everyone. Group fun? Private coaching? Equipment rental? Progress tracking? You name it, we’ve got it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our motto, inspired by Dr. Haraty himself: <span class="highlight">"The Sky is the Limit"</span>. So get ready to lace up those boots, hit the snow, and become part of our story. Because at HWCA, you're not just joining a course, you're joining a legacy.
